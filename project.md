#### National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)
- Theme: "Research on network computing model of urban functional area and its evolution"
- My Role: Leader, working on algorithm and system architecture design
- Duration: 01/2018 - 12/2020 
- Main Goal: 
Build network computing model based on human online and offline behavior, to discover and identify urban functional area and its spatio-temporal evolution. In order to understand the mechanism of interaction between small{human and urban functional area, and further analyze the law of emerging, changing, and evolution trend we small{tend to draw personal attributes to explore the driving force of development of urban functional area.
 
#### National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)
- Theme: "Analysis on the overlap and mutual enlargement of online and offline social networks"
- My Role: Leading researcher, working on model design and data driven analysis
- Duration: 01/2017 - 12/2020
